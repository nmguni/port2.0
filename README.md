# My Portfolio2.0

This is the second iteration of my portfolio. After building the first one I sent it out to local developers for for a review and they told me what I did good and what I need to improve to make it even better. I made notes of all the adjustments I need to make and I am applying those adjustments to portfolio 2.0.
